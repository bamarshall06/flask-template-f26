"""Talking to the class MySQL server.

Two things here are worth reading before you change them.

**The database is optional.** `is_configured()` is how the app knows whether a
connection string exists. Module 3 has no database and does not need one - the
site runs fine without it, and the Examples page politely says so. Module 4 is
when you are given one.

**A failure raises.** It does not return None and it does not print a warning
and carry on. A connection that quietly fails looks exactly like a table with no
rows in it, and you will spend an hour on the query before you think to check
the password.
